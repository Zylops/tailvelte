# TailwindCSS + Svelte Template (JIT Mode)

The vanilla sveltejs template but with tailwindcss configured in JIT mode.

## To use it in your project:

Run `npx degit zylops/tailvelte-jit .` in the project directory.

## To setup:

Run `npm install` to install all the default svelte dependencies and tailwindcss. Then run `npm run build:css` to start the tailwind compiler in watch mode. This way, the compiler listens to changes in your project files and rebuilds every time you save a file in the project directory.
